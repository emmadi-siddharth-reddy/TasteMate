🍳 TasteMate – Quick Recipe Generator
📌 Overview

TasteMate is a simple and intuitive web application designed for people who come home after a long day and want to cook something quick and easy. The app provides two main features:

Quick Recipes Section – A set of simple and ready-to-cook recipes displayed instantly for users who don’t want to waste time.

Custom Recipe Generator – Users can enter the ingredients they have in hand, and the app will generate a recipe suggestion tailored to those ingredients.

This combination ensures that whether you want a quick pick or a custom dish, TasteMate has you covered.

🎯 Motivation

The main idea behind this UI is to make cooking stress-free for busy individuals.

After work, people are usually tired and want something quick.

Instead of scrolling endlessly on the internet, they can:

Pick a ready-made recipe from the Quick Recipe section.

Or, generate a recipe with whatever ingredients they already have at home.

This saves both time and effort.
